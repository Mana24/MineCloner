# Console-Snake
Snake but it's entirely in the console. 

# Controls
* [Z] Double framerate to go zoom zoom
* [ESC] Exit game
* [R] Restart
* [Arrow Keys] Movement

# Disclaimer
Some of the code for console performance was taken from Quill18's Game on https://github.com/quill18/ld36 and then modified by me.
